# Programming Final project

## Introduction

A cookbook is a kitchen reference containing recipes. As a symbol of human civilization, ancient Mesopotamian cookbooks have dated back to about 1700 BC. With the advent of the printing press, modern cookbooks emerged between the 16th and 17th centuries – they were published by noble families to detail their recipes in competition with their rivals. Besides abundant documentations of ingredients, cooking techniques, and kitchen equipment, cookbooks also carry the memories, wisdom, hopes, and dreams of generations of chefs. They serve as an authentic manifestation of taste, a cultural inheritance of flavor, an ultimate pursuit of beauty, and most importantly, an intrinsic enthusiasm for creation. The best cookbook contains recipes that best fit the moment – it learns what you think, suggests what you want, and creates what you need. 

You are more ready than ever to prepare such a cookbook via Python programming, which is super exciting! The final project, The Only Cookbook You Ever Need, will grant you and your teammate a special opportunity to establish an interactive program that provides the optimal recipes based on your personalized requirements such as ingredients, calorie intake, cooking time, and servings. While working hard on your finals, we genuinely hope you enjoy leveraging Python programming skills to transform your daily life!

Components:
•	Basic (60% of the total grade): We have designed 6 questions for each group to help you build the essential features of the cookbook. Members of the same group should meet and evenly distribute the questions. Three questions should be assigned for each individual with no overlap on the choice of questions. The code needs to be complete, error-proofing, and readable. 
•	Advanced (40% of the total grade): We have designed 7 questions for each group to enhance the functionality of the cookbook. Each individual member of the group should choose two questions to address (four questions in total for each team). Members of the same group should meet and discuss to ensure no overlap on the choice of the questions. The code needs to be complete, error-proofing, and readable. 

Submission:
•	1) Basic component: one Jupyter notebook per individual 
File name: FirstName_LastName_Team_Index_basic.ipynb.
•	2) Advanced component: one Jupyter notebook per individual
File name: FirstName_LastName_Team_Index_advanced.ipynb.
